videoApp
========
This was my first project I did in the General Assembly web development course. The goal of this project was to create an easy to use imgur like service for video uploading and sharing. You can try out the site [here](http://easyvid.heroku.com). Please excuse the simple UI I spent most of my time getting all the functionality done. Technologies used include: Ruby on Rails, some javascript, Amazon S3, CORS, and Cloudfront.

After choosing a file either by click the button or dragging from your computer the video begins uploading directly to S3.

You are then taken to a page while you wait for your video to be encoded via the Heywatch API.</p><p>

When your video is finished being processed it will be displayed on this page.
