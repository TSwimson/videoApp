videoApp
========
This was my first project I did in the General Assembly web development course. The goal of this project was to create an easy to use imgur like service for video uploading and sharing. You can try out the site [here](http://easyvid.heroku.com). Please excuse the simple UI I spent most of my time getting all the functionality done. Technologies used include: Ruby on Rails, some javascript, Amazon S3, CORS, and Cloudfront.
